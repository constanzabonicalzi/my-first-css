                Countries have fallen short in their commitments to build back better after the COVID-19 pandemic, 
                with just 18 per cent of announced recovery spending going towards ‘green’ investment, 
                according to a new report published on Wednesday by the UN and Oxford University.

            The study analyses pandemic-related fiscal policies of 50 leading economies and reveals that only 
            $386 billion of the $46 trillion spent last year, could be considered green and sustainable.

            The research was led by Oxford’s Economic Recovery Project and the Global Recovery Observatory, 
            an initiative based at the university, together with the UN Environment Programme (

            “Governments have a unique chance to put their countries on sustainable trajectories that prioritize economic opportunity, 
            poverty reduction and planetary health at once - the Observatory gives them the tools to navigate to more sustainable and inclusive recoveries.”
